### Controller Issues?

If your controller isn't working correctly or shows phantom button presses:

1. **Use the Debug Tool**: Open `controller_debug.html` to see exactly what your controller reports
   - Check button indices when pressing each button
   - Check axis values for D-pad movement
   - Use this info to understand your controller's layout

2. **Check Browser Compatibility**: 
   - Chrome/Edge: Best support
   - Firefox: Good support
   - Safari: May have quirks with some controllers

3. **Try Different Connection Methods**:
   - USB vs Bluetooth can report differently
   - Some controllers need specific modes (e.g., D-pad vs X-input mode)

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Phantom Button Presses (Pro Controller Issue)
If you see buttons being pressed when nothing is touched:
- This was a mapping issue that's now fixed in the latest version
- The Pro Controller uses buttons 11-14 for D-pad, not axes
- Make sure you're using the latest `script.js`

### Controller Not Detected
- Try unplugging and replugging the controller
- Refresh the page after connecting
- Check browser console for error messages

### Stuck Buttons
- Press **ESCAPE** key to clear all stuck states
- This is an emergency cleanup that resets everything
